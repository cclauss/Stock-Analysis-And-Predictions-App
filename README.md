# Stock-Analysis-And-Predictions-App

This is a basic stock analyzing and prediction app that can analyze the real-time value of every stock symbol listed on the NYSE, using historical data available, and at the same time, it can also predict the future price of that stock symbol based on present data between a given time interval. 

Using "yfinance" library from Yahoo Finance (https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) and "Prophet" library from Meta (https://github.com/facebook/prophet) mainly, it will help to gather historical data and analyze the data to produce the graph, one for stock price analysis, another for prediction analysis. Also, we can check the symbol list of the portfolio, and we can generate a portfolio graph of all the symbols listed in that portfolio. The graphs are generated using "matplotlib" library, but it is intended not to make the graph interactive and is made to make the graph static. 

This has been one of the challenging projects due to the installing complexity of the "Prophet" library, as it failed to build the wheel for installing the necessary library at first, but it ultimately went as planned and the result was more than I expected! You all can try this code, and I hope you all will enjoy this! üòÅ
